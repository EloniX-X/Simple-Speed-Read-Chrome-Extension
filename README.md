# Simple-Speed-Read-Chrome-Extension
This is gonna be part of my project ELN to make a bunch of tools I can use in school. What I did for this project was I wanted to shift away from using python so for this I just made a simple javascript html css type extension in chrome. from this project I learned a lot of things but specifically javascript which I will have to practice a lot more. Javascript is a priority for me to learn as I shift to fullstack development.
